# uiuc-beamer-theme
 UIUC Colors and Logos for Beamer Slide Deck
 Code adopted from `illinois-r/uiucthemes` by `Coatless` and formatted for `LaTeX`.
 
 ## Instructions:
* Download the repository to a local folder on your machine and edit the `01-uiuc-theme.tex` file directly. 
* Ensure that the `images-logos` folder is living within the same folder as the `.tex` file so that UIUC logos and wordmarks appear in the slides.
 
 ## Credits
* This `LaTeX` file was produced using repurposed code previously written by `coatless` in the `illinois-r/uiucthemes` [package](https://github.com/illinois-r/uiucthemes).
