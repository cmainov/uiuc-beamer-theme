# uiuc-beamer-theme
 UIUC Colors and Logos for Beamer Slide Deck
 Code adopted from `illinois-r/uiucthemes` and formatted for `beamer` presentation slides in `LaTeX`.
 
 ## Instructions
 * Accessing and typesetting this file will require a `TeX` distribution system installed on your machine.
* Download the repository to a local folder on your machine and edit the `01-uiuc-theme.tex` file directly. 
* Ensure that the `images-logos` folder is living within the same folder as the `.tex` file so that UIUC logos and wordmarks appear in the slides.
